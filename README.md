I took this course on coursera.org, under the specialization: Full-Stack Web Development with React held by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br>
This course gave me an overview of client-side web UI frameworks, in particular Bootstrap 4. I learned about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. I also learned the basics of Node.js and NPM.

During this course I had to submit an assignment every week, for four weeks. At the end of this course, I was able to a)Set up, design and style a web page using Bootstrap 4 and its components, b) Create a responsive web page design, and c) Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.<br>
