I took this course on coursera.org, under the specialization: Full-Stack Web Development with React held by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Here you can see the certificate: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2Eo23kMfuvEO8UEnD2-Kn_2Bl1kEHx0/view?usp=sharing<br>
This course gave me an overview of client-side web UI frameworks, in particular Bootstrap 4. I learned about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. I also learned the basics of Node.js and NPM.
<br>
During this course I had to submit an assignment every week, for four weeks. At the end of this course, I was able to a)Set up, design and style a web page using Bootstrap 4 and its components, b) Create a responsive web page design, and c) Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.<br>
Week 1: Front-end Web UI Frameworks Overview: Bootstrap<br>
This module gives a quick introduction to full-stack web development and the outline of the course. Then I learned the basics of Bootstrap, setting up a web project using Bootstrap. I learned about responsive design and the Bootstrap grid system.<br>

Week 2: Bootstrap CSS Components<br>
This module concentrates on Bootstrap's components that are designed using pure CSS classes. I learned about Navigation and Navigation bar. Then, I learned about buttons, forms, tables, cards, images and media, tags, alerts and progress bars.<br>
Assignment 2: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Designed a form to enable users to submit a reservation request for a table. Note that at this stage the form will be inactive. This form should have been included in a new content row that you create just before the footer of the page.<br>
-Formatted the contents of the second row of the page using media class. The content column of the row should have been converted to a media object. In addition it should include a badge.<br>
-Added a button to the Jumbotron to enable users to access the form to reserve a table at the restaurant. Clicking on this button should take you to the reservation form at the bottom of the page.<br>
